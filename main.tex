\section{Introduction}
\hspace*{2em}For this second assignment, mechanical response analysis will be conducted using a
simple squared geometry model with a circular inclusion in the center. Hence, the analysis will be 
divided into three tasks. The first task is mesh sensitivity analysis, where the main goal of this first 
task is to see the influence of variety of mesh sizes to the captured stress concentration generation along the defined line
from the edge of the circular hole until the opposite edge of the plate. Then there's 
come the second task, where the focus will be to investigate the isotropic and kinematic hardening 
effect to its mechanical response. The last task is a subroutine implementation, where the objective
is to point out the difference between the standard and UMAT results. Extracting some other information will be done 
as well in the third task. 

\hspace*{2em}In this following section, each question will systematically will be addressed in the assignment,
providing detailed explanations, derivations, and relevant figures or tables to support the
analysis. All calculations and results are based on the provided data and the authorâ€™s
unique identification number. Numerical analysis will be performed using Abaqus CAE
with an appropriate boundary condition and settings. 


\section{Set up of the Model}
\hspace*{2em}For the model setup, 2D planar-deformable shell-model will be used for the plate with the specified geometry, boundary condition, material properties, and mesh.  
\subsection{Geometry and Boundary Conditions}

        fixed support restriction in y direction on the bottom line of the plate, fixed support point on the bottom right point restriction to 
        x direction, and stress constant distribution along the top plate line with value of $\sigma_{nominal} = 1 \;\text{MPa}$}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Material Properties}
\hspace*{2em}The material properties used in the analysis are provided in the task definition. However, 
some parameters must be manually calculated based on the author's Immatrikulation Nummer in the very first section.

\end{table}

\subsection{Meshing}

\hspace{2em}The baseplate with circular hole is mesh using a structured mesh, hence 
the partitioning is well-defined to ensure a good mesh quality. As requested by the task, 
the baseplate is partitioned using the general formatting guidelines. However, the author 
have the freedom to adjust the partitioned size. Therefore, for this assignment the dimensioning
of the mesh partition follows the provided Figure~\ref{fig:MeshPartitioning}. 

\hspace{2em} After the plate partitioning, specifically for task 1, the baseplate will be mesh
using 8 variations in the mesh size, where it is based on the global and local mesh size. 
The global mesh size is defined as the mesh size for the entire plate, 
while the local mesh size is defined as the mesh size around the circular hole (hence is the
area inside the small square partition). This method is done in order to capture the stress
concentration effects on the area near the hole accurately while maintaining a low computational
effort since the mesh size is not fine for the whole plate.

\hspace{2em}In order to know the mesh influence on the results, a mesh sensitivity
analysis is performed. This analysis involves systematically varying the mesh sizes and observing the effects on the simulation results, 
particularly the stress distribution around the circular hole. Therefore, mesh variation in
table~\ref{tab:mesh-sizes} is used for this study.

    circular hole. The whole mesh variations use CPS4, which is a 4-node bilinear plane stress quadrilateral element, 
    also using quad-structured mesh control feature for the whole region to retain structured mesh
    and avoid extreme-distorted element.}

\textbf{Table Description:} This table summarizes the eight mesh configurations used in the mesh sensitivity analysis. Each mesh is defined by its global mesh size (applied to the entire plate) and a finer local mesh size (applied around the circular hole) to accurately capture stress concentrations while optimizing computational efficiency.

\textit{$\dots$ Create the model as shown in figure 1, using the face partitioning illustrated in figure 2,

and a homogeneous, isotropic, linear elastic material. For each mesh size specified in 
table 1, create a separate Job. Apply the local mesh size around the hole and use the 
global mesh size for the remaining regions of the plate.}

efficient representation of stress concentration, and explain why it should be chosen.}
